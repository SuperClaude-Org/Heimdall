# Patch Reorganization Summary

## Completed Domain-Based Patch Split

Successfully reorganized Heimdall branding patches from 3 overlapping files into 4 domain-specific patch files for better maintainability and modularity.

### New Domain-Based Structure

#### 01-core-branding.hpatch.json
- **Purpose**: Core system identifiers and package naming
- **Content**: 
  - Package.json name changes (opencode → heimdall)
  - Binary file references (OPENCODE_BIN_PATH → HEIMDALL_BIN_PATH)  
  - Core import statements
  - System binary naming (opencode.exe → heimdall.exe)

#### 02-ui-visual.hpatch.json
- **Purpose**: Visual branding elements including ASCII art
- **Content**:
  - ASCII art logo replacement in TypeScript UI
  - Logo function updates (color: gray → cyan)
  - Go TUI ASCII art injection
  - Visual component branding

#### 03-cli-commands.hpatch.json
- **Purpose**: CLI interface and user-facing text
- **Content**:
  - Command descriptions (start opencode tui → start heimdall tui)
  - Function name changes (getOpencodeCommand → getHeimdallCommand)
  - Welcome messages and CLI branding text
  - Go TUI text updates

#### 04-environment-config.hpatch.json  
- **Purpose**: Environment variables and configuration
- **Content**:
  - Environment variable updates (OPENCODE_* → HEIMDALL_*)
  - Global type declarations (OPENCODE_TUI_PATH → HEIMDALL_TUI_PATH)
  - Configuration file paths and constants

### Legacy Files
Moved original patch files to `build/patches/legacy/`:
- ascii-art-branding.hpatch.json
- enhanced-ui-branding.hpatch.json  
- heimdall-branding.hpatch.json

### Benefits Achieved
✅ **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns by domain
✅ **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and update specific functionality
✅ **Selective Application**: Can apply/skip specific domains if needed
✅ **Review Process**: Smaller, focused patch files for easier review
✅ **Dependency Order**: Numbered prefixes ensure correct application sequence

### Verification
- Dry run test successful: `./build/bin/heimdall build --dry-run`
- Patch verification initiated: `./build/bin/heimdall patch --verify`
- All 4 new domain patches recognized by the build system
- Legacy patches preserved in case rollback needed

### Usage
The build system will now apply patches in dependency order:
1. Core branding (package names, binaries)
2. UI visual elements (ASCII art, logos)  
3. CLI commands (user interface text)
4. Environment configuration (variables, paths)

This structure provides optimal balance between organization and functionality for the Heimdall patching system.
